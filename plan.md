1. Understand and Gather the Data

Data Collection: Gather historical wildfire data, which might include:

Geographic locations (latitude and longitude).

Dates and times of fire occurrence.

Climate data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).

Vegetation type, soil moisture, or any other relevant environmental factors.

Historical trends or patterns (e.g., number of fires per month or per region).


Data Preprocessing: Often, the data will be in various formats (CSV, JSON, etc.). Use file handling in C to read and preprocess this data. You may need to clean the data, handle missing values, or normalize certain features.


2. Define Project Structure

Modular Design: Divide your project into modules, such as:

Data Input Module: Handles reading and preprocessing data from files.

Feature Extraction Module: Processes the data to extract relevant features (e.g., temperature patterns, wind direction).

Prediction Algorithm Module: Contains the code for predicting wildfire locations.

Output Module: Displays or saves results.



3. Preprocessing and Feature Extraction

Use statistical methods to extract meaningful information from the raw data:

Calculate averages or trends in climate data over months or years.

Identify regions with frequent fires and analyze their characteristics.


Organize the data for each year or month into a struct that holds features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., which can be used as input to your prediction model.


4. Implementing Prediction Logic

In C, implementing machine learning models from scratch can be complex. You have two main approaches:

Custom Statistical Analysis: Develop custom rules based on patterns in data. For instance:

If regions with high temperatures and low humidity are prone to fires, use these as thresholds.

Apply regression techniques or correlation coefficients to establish relationships between variables.


Basic Machine Learning (using libraries): Though C doesn’t have robust ML libraries, you can integrate with C-compatible libraries like libsvm for support vector machines or use fann (Fast Artificial Neural Network) for simple neural networks.


Algorithm Choice: For a first pass, a regression approach might work to predict wildfire likelihood based on climate factors. More advanced techniques, like clustering (to identify fire-prone regions) or decision trees, can offer refined predictions.


5. Code Structure and Data Handling in C

Define data structures (e.g., structs for data points) to hold each data record and manage data flow within the program.

Implement functions for data parsing (e.g., reading CSV files).

Use loops to iterate through historical data records and apply your prediction algorithm to each new data point.

Track variables for real-time predictions based on inputs (such as a struct that updates daily with new data).


6. Testing and Validation

Split your dataset: Use one part of the historical data for training (creating patterns/thresholds) and another for testing.

Evaluation Metrics: Choose metrics to evaluate the model’s performance, like accuracy or false-positive rate (how many areas are wrongly predicted to be fire-prone).

Optimize: Adjust parameters (thresholds, weights, etc.) based on validation results to improve prediction accuracy.


7. Output Results

Display potential future wildfire locations in a human-readable format.

Consider saving the results to a file or generating a simple map by printing coordinates on a grid layout for visualization.


8. Documentation and Comments

Document each module and function for ease of understanding and future improvements.

Comment on your code extensively to explain each step and any mathematical logic used for the predictions.

Example Code Snippets

Here’s a simplified version of what some parts of this project might look like:

Define a Data Structure

typedef struct {
    float latitude;
    float longitude;
    float temperature;
    float humidity;
    float wind_speed;
    int month;
    int year;
} WildfireData;

Reading Data from a CSV File

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void readData(const char *filename, WildfireData *dataArray, int *count) {
    FILE *file = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (!file) {
        printf("Error opening file.\n");
        return;
    }

    while (fscanf(file, "%f,%f,%f,%f,%f,%d,%d",
                  &dataArray[*count].latitude,
                  &dataArray[*count].longitude,
                  &dataArray[*count].temperature,
                  &dataArray[*count].humidity,
                  &dataArray[*count].wind_speed,
                  &dataArray[*count].month,
                  &dataArray[*count].year) == 7) {
        (*count)++;
    }
    fclose(file);
}

Simple Prediction Function (Using Thresholds)

int predictFireRisk(WildfireData data) {
    // Hypothetical threshold values
    if (data.temperature > 35.0 && data.humidity < 20.0 && data.wind_speed > 15.0) {
        return 1; // High risk
    }
    return 0; // Low risk
}

Using Prediction

void processPredictions(WildfireData *dataArray, int count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        int risk = predictFireRisk(dataArray[i]);
        printf("Location (%f, %f) has a %s risk of fire.\n",
               dataArray[i].latitude, dataArray[i].longitude,
               risk ? "HIGH" : "LOW");
    }
}

Further Development

Visualization: You can integrate with GIS (Geographic Information System) tools or output predictions to a map-based visualization program.

Improvement with Machine Learning: As you grow more comfortable, consider transitioning parts of the logic to Python for easier ML model development and then linking it back with your C project using Python-C integration techniques.

Real-time Prediction: You could add real-time data feeds to assess current risk dynamically, making it more adaptable to live conditions.


This approach provides a foundational structure for a predictive wildfire tracking project using historical data in C.
